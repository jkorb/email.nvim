# email.nvim

This plugin helps with editing mail in nvim. It's very much inspired by
`vim-email` [https://github.com/dbeniamine/vim-mail], and you're probably better
off using the original plugin. I wrote `email.nvim` to learn more about lua
plugins and to accommodate my personal taste. This is a WIP, so expect
frequent(-ish, possibly breaking) changes. That said, if you can get anything
out of this, have at it :)
